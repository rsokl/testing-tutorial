    "# parameterizing a test\n",

    "\n",
    "Make note that a pytest-parameterized test must be run using pytest; an error will raise if we manually call `test_range_length()` from within a Python REPL.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is often the case that the process of *describing our data* is by far the heaviest burden that we must bear when writing tests. This process of assessing \"what variety of values should I test?\", \"have I thought of all the important edge-cases?\", and \"how much is 'enough'?\" will crop up with nearly every test that we write.\n",
    "Indeed, these are questions that you may have been asking yourself when writing `test_count_vowels_basic` and `test_merge_max_mappings` in the previous sections of this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) is a powerful Python library that empowers us to write a _description_ (specification, to be more precise) of the data that we want to use to exercise our test.\n",
    "It will then *generate* test cases that satisfy this description and will run our test on these cases.\n",
    "Let's witness this in its most basic form.\n",

    "```\n",

    "The `@given` decorator is to be fed one or more *Hypothesis strategies* for describing data.\n",
    "In this example, we specified a single strategy, which describes arbitrary integer values.\n",
    "Executing `a_test_using_hypothesis()` will prompt Hypothesis to run the test's body _multiple times_ (100 times, by default); for run draws a new set of values from the strategies that we provided to `@given`.\n",
    "\n",

    "# unlike a pytest-parameterized test, tests using hypothesis\n",
    "# can be run outside of the pytest framework\n",
